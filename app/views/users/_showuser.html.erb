                "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
                pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
                account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
                rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
                but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
                encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
                anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
                because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in
                which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a
                trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
                exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
                right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
                has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces
                no resultant pleasure?"
